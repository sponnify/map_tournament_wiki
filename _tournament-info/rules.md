## Toxicity
Toxic behavior, including harassment, discrimination, and derogatory language, is strictly prohibited. Any reports of such behavior will be taken seriously and may result in penalties for the player or team involved. Practice common sense.

### During Matches
If a player exhibits toxic or unsportsmanlike behavior during a match, the referee will issue a warning and notify an admin if necessary. If the referee does not identify any reportable behavior, players can bring the issue to admins directly. Unless admins decide otherwise, the match will continue as normal, and any consequences will be determined after the match.

### Outside Matches
Behavior issues outside of matches should be reported to admins directly. Provide as much detail as possible to assist with the investigation.

Conditions for disqualification include, but are not limited to:

## Reporting Toxic Behavior
