## Warmup Gimmick

### How It Works
The warmup gimmick is a unique feature of the tournament designed to recognize and reward outstanding maps. During the warmup phase of each match, teams have the opportunity to showcase exceptional maps that have not been widely seen before.

### Earning a Free Point
If a team's chosen warmup map impresses the mapping board member present at the match, the team can earn a free point. This is a rare and prestigious reward, given only if the map truly stands out and impresses the mapping board member. Only one point can be awarded per match, so the decision is made with careful consideration.

### Criteria for Earning a Free Point
To be eligible for a free point, the warmup map must meet the following criteria:
- The map must not have been seen by the mapping board member before.
- The map must thoroughly impress the mapping board member.

### Participation Requirements
To participate in the warmup gimmick, teams must provide the following information during scheduling:
1. Include the date and time of their match in the scheduling.
2. Indicate whether both teams agree to participate in the warmup gimmick.
3. Provide the maps chosen by both teams for the warmup in advance.

[provide images of scheduling examples that include participating in the warmup gimmick, declining the warmup gimmick, or a mapper not able to be present]

This information is crucial for the mapping board, streamers, and commentators to prepare and ensure a smooth process.

### Mapping Board Attendance
The warmup gimmick depends on the availability of a mapping board member. If a member is assigned to your match, they will review the warmup maps in advance and decide if a point will be awarded. If no member is available, the warmup gimmick will not be applied to your match, but you are still free to play your warmup maps as usual.

### Announcement of Results
You will not know the results of whether a map has met the condition for a free point until the warmup stage has been completed. The referee of the match will announce if a map has been awarded a free point, or will provide a brief explanation as to why it wasn't.

### Posting of Winners
All maps that have been awarded free points will be posted in the #warmup-winners channel in the Discord server. The mapping board member awarding the point will write a brief explanation of why they decided the map was worthy of a point. This will be done some time after the match concludes.

### Important Note
If an opposing team wishes not to participate in the warmup gimmick, no free points will be awarded.

By participating in the warmup gimmick, teams contribute to the overall goal of the tournament: highlighting and celebrating outstanding maps within the community.

### TL;DR
The warmup gimmick allows teams to showcase exceptional maps during the warmup phase. If a mapping board member is impressed by a team's warmup map, the team can earn a free point. To participate, teams must include match details, agree to the gimmick, and provide warmup maps in advance in their scheduling. The map must not have been seen by the mapping board member before and must thoroughly impress them. The gimmick depends on the availability of a mapping board member to review the maps. If no member is available, the warmup gimmick won't apply, but teams can still play their warmup maps. Results will be announced by the referee after the warmup stage, and winning maps will be posted in the #warmup-winners channel in the Discord server with an explanation from the mapping board member. If an opposing team does not wish to participate in the warmup gimmick, no free points will be awarded.
